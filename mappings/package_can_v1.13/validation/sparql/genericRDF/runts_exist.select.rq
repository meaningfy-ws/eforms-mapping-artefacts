# A "runt" is a _minimal_ RDF subject resource that has little to no
# information associated with it other than a type assertion. It's like a
# short, insignificant word or line of text in typography. A traditional
# database analogue does not exist as schemas are typically rigid (a column is
# either required or not). In networking terms, it might be akin to a small,
# low-priority data packet that doesn't carry much substantive information.
# While runts may very well be a valid occurrence in RDF, they may -- more
# often than not -- signal data errors.
#
# Another situation could be that of a "widow" -- an _isolated_ RDF object
# resource that does not have statements of its own (not even a type
# assertion), similar to a typographic widow. It's like a word or line of text
# that stands alone at the top of a paragraph. In traditional databases this
# can rarely occur as referential integrity checks ensure referenced records
# exist. In networking terms, it's comparable to a data packet that has no
# preceding or subsequent packets in the flow. Widows are not a valid
# occurrence in RDF either, as objects with no information almost always signal
# a data error.
#
# In RML mapping, however, this situation cannot arise as referenced
# parentTriplesMaps of predicateObjectMaps (the only situation where a
# relationship is established) usually have a type associated, yielding at
# least a runt, but not a widow.

  epo:hasAdditionalInformation """In accordance with section 134 a of the Danish Public Procurement Act the contracting entity shall exclude a candidate or tenderer from participation in a procurement procedure where the candidate or tenderer is established in a country that is included EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes and has not acceded to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement or other trade agreements committing Denmark to open the public procurement market to tenderers established in that country. However, for reasons of overriding public interest, the contracting entity may refrain from excluding a candidate or tenderer that is subject to the ground for exclusion. 

No particular legal form is required. If the agreement is awarded to a group of suppliers (e.g. a consortium), the participants shall undertake joint and several liability and appoint one supplier to represent the group. 

It is pointed out that this procedure is subject to Article 5k of Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014, as amended. The provision contains a prohibition against award of contracts to Russian companies and Russian-controlled companies etc. (reference is made to Article 5k, section 1 for the exact delimitation of the operators that are subject to the prohibition). The Purchaser reserves the right at any time during the tender process to require candidates or tenderers to prove that they are not subject to the prohibition, for example by requiring documentation regarding the candidates’ or tenderers and any subcontractors’ place of establishment and ownership. 

As part of the request to participate, the candidate must submit a self-declaration on compliance with labour clauses, CSR obligations and international sanctions. The Purchaser reserves the right, at any time during the tender process, to let the candidate rectify a missing or inadequately completed self-declaration. 

The Purchaser has uploaded a template, Self-declaration (available in the electronic tender system) which must be used, when submitting the application. 

Where groups of entities (e.g. consortiums), including temporary joint ventures, participate jointly in the tender procedure, the declaration must be provided separately for each of the participating entities. 

The Contracting Authorities reserve the right – but is not obliged – to use the remedies provided for in section 159(5) of the Danish Act no. 1564 of 15 December 2015, as amended, the Public Procurement Act, if requests to participate or offers do not fulfil the requirements of the tender documents. It should be noted that irrespective of the wording of the requirements of the tender documents to the effect that information, declarations and documentation must be submitted, e.g. concerning a description of the deliverables put up for tender, the Purchaser is not prevented from obtaining additional information, etc., pursuant to the procedure in section 159(5), cf. section 159(6) of the Public Procurement Act. 

Any questions regarding the request to participate must be submitted through the electronic tender system. Questions will be anonymised, and the answers will be posted in the electronic tender system. 

Questions received within the deadline stated in 5.1.11 in this contract notice will be answered by the Purchaser no later than 6 days before the deadline for request to participate, see 5.1.12 in this contract notice. However, questions received later than the deadline in 5.1.11 in this contract notice will be answered unless the nature of the question makes it disproportionately onerous for contracting authorities to answer six days before the deadline for request to participate. Answers to questions received later than 6 days before the deadline of the request to participate cannot be expected. 

On 03. September 2024 at 11:00 CET a digital information meeting will be held for all interested parties via Microsoft TEAMS. 

In order to participate candidates are kindly asked to inform via the electronic tender system no later than three days before the meeting is held that the candidate will participate in the meeting. 

Participants who have signed up for the information meeting will receive a link for the video conference. 

During the meeting, the Purchaser will explain the background of the tender procedure and the purpose of the procurement. General information as to the structure and content of the tender documents will also be provided. 

Participants must provide the following information: Company name, the full names of the participant(s) and the e-mail to whom the link for the meeting should be sent to. Questions may be asked during the information meeting. However, the Purchaser reserves the right to refer the participants to present the questions in writing instead if, according to the Purchaser, it is not suitable or possible to answer such questions during the meeting. 

The Purchaser will prepare a brief MoM of the information meeting which will subsequently be uploaded to the electronic tender system. 

The Purchaser demands that the candidate and each of the legal entities on whose economic and financial capacities the candidate relies, undertake joint and several liability for the performance of the agreement. 

The estimated value of the framework agreement is 1.000.000.000 EUR, and the maximum value of the framework agreement is 2.500.000.000 EUR. The reason for the difference between the stated values is the uncertainty regarding the final value of the framework agreement, see below. Hence, the estimated value constitutes the Purchaser’s most qualified estimate of the value of the framework agreement at the present moment, while the maximum value constitutes the maximum value of purchases under the framework agreement in its duration. 

The uncertainty regarding the final value of the framework agreement is caused by multiple factors. 

For one, the durability of the delivered clothing will very likely vary from supplier to supplier. The rate of replacement per item is a significant factor for the actual number of items required throughout the duration of the framework agreement. Therefore, this factor creates uncertainty regarding the total number of items requested and accordingly the actual financial value of the framework agreement. In the same way the amount of personnel requiring clothing is likely to be changed throughout the duration of the framework agreement. In case one or more of the participating nations increase their number of conscripts or extend the duration of their conscripts’ service this will have an impact on the actual number of items required throughout the duration of the framework agreement and affect the financial value accordingly. 

Furthermore, the uncertainty regarding the final value of the framework agreement is caused by the uncertainty related to the initial pricing as well as the price development throughout the duration of the framework agreement. The contracting authorities foresee a significant spread in the initial pricing which combined with the uncertainty related to the price development throughout the duration of the framework agreement potentially will have a severe impact on the actual financial value of the framework agreement. 

Also, various external factors such as changes in the geopolitical situation is a factor that potentially may have a significant impact on the actual financial value of the framework agreement as this may call for participation in more international operations on a global scale. 

In case the Purchaser receives less than 4 compliant requests for participation the Purchaser reserves the right to continue the tender process with less than 4 prequalified candidates. 

The selection will be based on an assessment of criteria 1 (References), 2 (Security of Supply), and 3 (Environmental targets) under the section for Technical and Professional Capacity above. 

The selection will be carried out in accordance with selection criteria 1 (References), 2 (Security of Supply), and 3 (Environmental targets) under the section for Technical and Professional Capacity. Each selection criteria respectively contains a description of which subject matter that is assessed positively in the selection.

For the overall assessment of the candidates request to participate selection criteria 1 and 2 will be emphasized twice as much as selection criterion 3."""@en;

  dct:description """This tender concerns a joint procurement of the Nordic Combat Uniform (NCU) system between the Danish Ministry of Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organisation (the Purchaser), the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA). The purpose of the tender is to establish a non-exclusive framework agreement for each of the above mentioned national administrative entities that allows each entity to procure the items of the NCU system. With the exception of the provisions regarding governing law and dispute resolution the framework agreement will be identical for each of the participating national administrative entities. However, each national participating entity will enter its separate framework agreement with the supplier awarded the framework agreement. For each framework agreement applicable law for contractual disputes will be the national law of the nation of the relevant contracting authority. 

The NCU system is soldier clothing next to skin and ends at the outermost area providing a shell cover. The different elements in conjunction with other or by themselves are designed to contribute to the soldiers’ ability to withstand the demands, threats and hazards in order to solve the tasks at hand. The NCU system consists of various items enabling the soldier to perform and survive in combat missions. The aim of the NCU system is to provide the soldier with protection against threats to the soldier in his/her operating environments. 

The NCU system is meant to supplement the existing combat uniform system, including outer, mid and inner layers under the concept 'more of the same'. The combat uniform system is for any gender soldier within any military service. The NCU system is for use in all geographical areas where the three nations are or could be engaged in military operations. 

The Framework Agreement shall cover any need of the various items included in the NCU system. The inner and mid layers are configured in knitting material made of wool and compositions of wool. It is anticipated to be demanded as an example in the range of 500.000 to 1.000.000 pcs. yearly. Please notice that the figures given are exemplified estimates and may be subject to change. The outer layers including combat, insulation and rain layers are likewise anticipated to be demanded as an example in the range of 400.000 – 800.000 pcs. yearly. Please notice that the given figures given are exemplified estimates and may be subject to change."""@en;

  epo:hasAdditionalInformation """In accordance with section 134 a of the Danish Public Procurement Act the contracting entity shall exclude a candidate or tenderer from participation in a procurement procedure where the candidate or tenderer is established in a country that is included EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes and has not acceded to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement or other trade agreements committing Denmark to open the public procurement market to tenderers established in that country. However, for reasons of overriding public interest, the contracting entity may refrain from excluding a candidate or tenderer that is subject to the ground for exclusion. 

No particular legal form is required. If the agreement is awarded to a group of suppliers (e.g. a consortium), the participants shall undertake joint and several liability and appoint one supplier to represent the group. 

It is pointed out that this procedure is subject to Article 5k of Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014, as amended. The provision contains a prohibition against award of contracts to Russian companies and Russian-controlled companies etc. (reference is made to Article 5k, section 1 for the exact delimitation of the operators that are subject to the prohibition). The Purchaser reserves the right at any time during the tender process to require candidates or tenderers to prove that they are not subject to the prohibition, for example by requiring documentation regarding the candidates’ or tenderers and any subcontractors’ place of establishment and ownership. 

As part of the request to participate, the candidate must submit a self-declaration on compliance with labour clauses, CSR obligations and international sanctions. The Purchaser reserves the right, at any time during the tender process, to let the candidate rectify a missing or inadequately completed self-declaration. 

The Purchaser has uploaded a template, Self-declaration (available in the electronic tender system) which must be used, when submitting the application. 

Where groups of entities (e.g. consortiums), including temporary joint ventures, participate jointly in the tender procedure, the declaration must be provided separately for each of the participating entities. 

The Contracting Authorities reserve the right – but is not obliged – to use the remedies provided for in section 159(5) of the Danish Act no. 1564 of 15 December 2015, as amended, the Public Procurement Act, if requests to participate or offers do not fulfil the requirements of the tender documents. It should be noted that irrespective of the wording of the requirements of the tender documents to the effect that information, declarations and documentation must be submitted, e.g. concerning a description of the deliverables put up for tender, the Purchaser is not prevented from obtaining additional information, etc., pursuant to the procedure in section 159(5), cf. section 159(6) of the Public Procurement Act. 

Any questions regarding the request to participate must be submitted through the electronic tender system. Questions will be anonymised, and the answers will be posted in the electronic tender system. 

Questions received within the deadline stated in 5.1.11 in this contract notice will be answered by the Purchaser no later than 6 days before the deadline for request to participate, see 5.1.12 in this contract notice. However, questions received later than the deadline in 5.1.11 in this contract notice will be answered unless the nature of the question makes it disproportionately onerous for contracting authorities to answer six days before the deadline for request to participate. Answers to questions received later than 6 days before the deadline of the request to participate cannot be expected. 

On 03. September 2024 at 11:00 CET a digital information meeting will be held for all interested parties via Microsoft TEAMS. 

In order to participate candidates are kindly asked to inform via the electronic tender system no later than three days before the meeting is held that the candidate will participate in the meeting. 

Participants who have signed up for the information meeting will receive a link for the video conference. 

During the meeting, the Purchaser will explain the background of the tender procedure and the purpose of the procurement. General information as to the structure and content of the tender documents will also be provided. 

Participants must provide the following information: Company name, the full names of the participant(s) and the e-mail to whom the link for the meeting should be sent to. Questions may be asked during the information meeting. However, the Purchaser reserves the right to refer the participants to present the questions in writing instead if, according to the Purchaser, it is not suitable or possible to answer such questions during the meeting. 

The Purchaser will prepare a brief MoM of the information meeting which will subsequently be uploaded to the electronic tender system. 

The Purchaser demands that the candidate and each of the legal entities on whose economic and financial capacities the candidate relies, undertake joint and several liability for the performance of the agreement. 

The estimated value of the framework agreement is 1.000.000.000 EUR, and the maximum value of the framework agreement is 2.500.000.000 EUR. The reason for the difference between the stated values is the uncertainty regarding the final value of the framework agreement, see below. Hence, the estimated value constitutes the Purchaser’s most qualified estimate of the value of the framework agreement at the present moment, while the maximum value constitutes the maximum value of purchases under the framework agreement in its duration. 

The uncertainty regarding the final value of the framework agreement is caused by multiple factors. 

For one, the durability of the delivered clothing will very likely vary from supplier to supplier. The rate of replacement per item is a significant factor for the actual number of items required throughout the duration of the framework agreement. Therefore, this factor creates uncertainty regarding the total number of items requested and accordingly the actual financial value of the framework agreement. In the same way the amount of personnel requiring clothing is likely to be changed throughout the duration of the framework agreement. In case one or more of the participating nations increase their number of conscripts or extend the duration of their conscripts’ service this will have an impact on the actual number of items required throughout the duration of the framework agreement and affect the financial value accordingly. 

Furthermore, the uncertainty regarding the final value of the framework agreement is caused by the uncertainty related to the initial pricing as well as the price development throughout the duration of the framework agreement. The contracting authorities foresee a significant spread in the initial pricing which combined with the uncertainty related to the price development throughout the duration of the framework agreement potentially will have a severe impact on the actual financial value of the framework agreement. 

Also, various external factors such as changes in the geopolitical situation is a factor that potentially may have a significant impact on the actual financial value of the framework agreement as this may call for participation in more international operations on a global scale. 

In case the Purchaser receives less than 4 compliant requests for participation the Purchaser reserves the right to continue the tender process with less than 4 prequalified candidates. 

The selection will be based on an assessment of criteria 1 (References), 2 (Security of Supply), and 3 (Environmental targets) under the section for Technical and Professional Capacity above. 

The selection will be carried out in accordance with selection criteria 1 (References), 2 (Security of Supply), and 3 (Environmental targets) under the section for Technical and Professional Capacity. Each selection criteria respectively contains a description of which subject matter that is assessed positively in the selection.

For the overall assessment of the candidates request to participate selection criteria 1 and 2 will be emphasized twice as much as selection criterion 3."""@en;

  epo:hasMainFeature """Please note that each candidate may only submit one request for participation.
The Purchaser has prepared a prequalification questionnaire (“PQQ”) which the candidates are encouraged to use when submitting their applications. The PQQ contains forms and templates for providing information etc. in accordance with the requirements in this Contract Notice. However, it is emphasized that it is the sole responsibility of the candidate that the information provided fulfils the requirements. The PQQ is available at the electronic procurement system. When submitting the offer (but not the request for participation/prequalification), the tenderer must submit a declaration stating that the tenderer (1) is not subject to any of the mandatory grounds for exclusion stated in Article 39(1) of the Defence and Security Directive and section 134 a of Act no. 1564 of 15 December 2015, as amended (the “Public Procurement Act”), and (2) to which degree the tenderer has unpaid overdue debt in relation to taxes or social security contributions under Danish law or under the law of the country in which the tenderer is established. A template for the declaration will be provided with the tender documents, which the tenderer may use. If the tenderer is composed of a group of entities (e.g. a consortium), including temporary joint ventures, a declaration must be submitted for each participating entity.  
  
Even if a candidate or a tenderer is subject to an exclusion ground, it will not be excluded if it has provided sufficient documentation that it is reliable. The Purchaser will decide whether the documentation is sufficient. The Purchaser’s assessment will be made according to the guidelines in section 138(1)-(4) of the Danish Act no. 1564 of 15 December 2015, as amended (the “Public Procurement Act”).

The Purchaser reserve the right to award the agreement based on the first indicative offer or any subsequent indicative offer. 

According to the Defence and Security Directive, a candidate may rely on the economic and financial standing  and/or technical and/or professional capacity of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links with the entities. If a candidate intends to rely on other entities and wants the capacity of such entities to be taken into account when the Purchaser assess the suitability of the candidate, the candidate must prove that the other entities will and are obliged to provide the relevant resources at the disposal of the candidate. A template for a declaration from the supporting entity to this effect is included in the PQQ referred to above.

The Purchaser has prepared a cover letter, which the candidates are encouraged to use when submitting the application for participation also available at the electronic procurement system platform."""@en;

  dct:description """This tender concerns a joint procurement of the Nordic Combat Uniform (NCU) system between the Danish Ministry of Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organisation (the Purchaser), the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA). The purpose of the tender is to establish a non-exclusive framework agreement for each of the above mentioned national administrative entities that allows each entity to procure the items of the NCU system. With the exception of the provisions regarding governing law and dispute resolution the framework agreement will be identical for each of the participating national administrative entities. However, each national participating entity will enter its separate framework agreement with the supplier awarded the framework agreement. For each framework agreement applicable law for contractual disputes will be the national law of the nation of the relevant contracting authority. 

The NCU system is soldier clothing next to skin and ends at the outermost area providing a shell cover. The different elements in conjunction with other or by themselves are designed to contribute to the soldiers’ ability to withstand the demands, threats and hazards in order to solve the tasks at hand. The NCU system consists of various items enabling the soldier to perform and survive in combat missions. The aim of the NCU system is to provide the soldier with protection against threats to the soldier in his/her operating environments. 

The NCU system is meant to supplement the existing combat uniform system, including outer, mid and inner layers under the concept 'more of the same'. The combat uniform system is for any gender soldier within any military service. The NCU system is for use in all geographical areas where the three nations are or could be engaged in military operations. 

The Framework Agreement shall cover any need of the various items included in the NCU system. The inner and mid layers are configured in knitting material made of wool and compositions of wool. It is anticipated to be demanded as an example in the range of 500.000 to 1.000.000 pcs. yearly. Please notice that the figures given are exemplified estimates and may be subject to change. The outer layers including combat, insulation and rain layers are likewise anticipated to be demanded as an example in the range of 400.000 – 800.000 pcs. yearly. Please notice that the given figures given are exemplified estimates and may be subject to change."""@en;

The list should preferably include a short description of each reference. The description of the references should include a clear indication of which specific parts of the references that are similar to the procurement described in section Object – Description of the procurement in the Contract Notice above and describe whether and to which extent the references concerned yarns and fabrics with properties as NIR, FR, WR, DWR, Permethrin, all with and without PFAS free ‘properties’ and POL. The description should also include a description of the candidate’s participation/role in the performance of each reference contract. It is emphasized that the candidate must have carried out actual production in order for the reference to be taken into account (references where the candidate has only delivered and not produced will be disregarded). The description should also include information about when delivery took place under each reference contract, the quantity/volume produced and delivered under the reference contract, and the recipients of the produced deliveries (specific names/countries are preferred, but not necessary. 
When specifying the date for the deliveries, the candidate should state the date of commencement and completion. If this is not possible, the candidate is asked to indicate in the description of the reference contract how the date is specified.
Only the references produced and delivered at the time of the deadline for the request to participate will be considered in the evaluation. If the reference contract in question is ongoing, it is only the part of the reference contract that has been delivered within the last three (3) years, and completed at the time of the deadline for the request to participate which will be included in the assessment of the reference. Consequently, if a part of the reference contract has not been carried out within the last three (3) years, or if a part of the reference contract has not been completed at the time of the deadline for the request to participate, this particular part will not be included in the assessment of the reference. Therefore, it is important that the candidate clearly states which part (in terms of quantity or volume) of an ongoing reference that has been carried out within the last three (3) years.
The list must contain a maximum of 10 previous deliveries (references), irrespective of whether the candidate is one entity, composed of a group of entities (e.g. a consortium), including temporary joint ventures, or relies on the technical and professional capacity of other entities. If the list contains more than 10, the Purchaser will only consider the first 10 deliveries on the list. Deliveries beyond that will not be considered.
The selection of candidates will be based on an evaluation of which candidates have documented the most relevant reference contracts in relation to the agreement/procurement described in section, Object – Description of the procurement  in the Contract Notice. 
In the evaluation of the relevance of the reference contracts, the contracting authority will take the following into account, in particular:
- That the reference contracts combined cover the various layers of the NCU combat uniform.
- That the reference contracts related to the various layers cover the special properties of NIR, FR, WR, DWR, Permethrin, all with or without PFAS free ‘properties’ and POL.
-That the volume/quantity produced and delivered under the reference contracts matches the volume/quantities that are expected to be delivered under this framework agreement.

The evaluation will be based on the list of references submitted by the candidates, see above. Please note that if the information submitted is unclear or unintelligible, this may be regarded negatively in the selection process."""@en;

                  <efac:Change>
                     <efbc:ChangeDescription languageID="ENG">In relation to the first modification, the Nomenclature of Economic Activities (“NACE”) index is used in the O&amp;M Contract as part of the indexation provisions of the O&amp;M Contract. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the indexation provisions in the O&amp;M Contract produced an irrational outcome, in circumstances where the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic affected different categories of worker in very different manners. The primary reason for the NACE Index not increasing in line with the contractor’s wage increases was the unforeseen collapse of the airline industry due to the worldwide COVID-19 travel restrictions which resulted in many airline staff being made redundant between 2020 and 2021 and minimal wage increases for staff that were retained. This meant that between Quarter 2 of 2019 and Quarter 2 of 2020, there was a significant and unforeseen decrease for the air transport sub-sector of NACE (c. 32%) whereas the average decrease for the three other sub-sectors of NACE was marginal (c. 3%). This significant reduction in the air transport sub-sector of NACE (as a result of the impacts of Covid-19) had a disproportionate cumulative impact on NACE Principal Activity H for 2021 such that there was no increase.  
In relation to the second modification, the contracting authorities agreed certain reliefs at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic which sought to limit the anticipated impacts on the contractor’s performance of the O&amp;M Contract including measures which sought to limit the contractor’s increased exposure to System Performance Deductions in accordance with the variation mechanism under the O&amp;M Contract as well as compensation for additional unforeseen costs related to providing a full service during the pandemic. It was agreed that these measures would be revisited at a later date. Upon review, it was agreed that the measures initially agreed were insufficient to compensate the operator for the additional costs and deductions incurred pursuant to the O&amp;M Contract arising by virtue of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
In each case, TII is satisfied that the modifications were necessary to ensure the continued provision of the services pursuant to the O&amp;M Contract, that the modifications were brought about by circumstances which a diligent contracting authority could not have foreseen (namely the Covid-19 pandemic) and that the modifications do not alter the overall nature of the O&amp;M Contract.</efbc:ChangeDescription>

                     <efbc:ReasonDescription languageID="ENG">Two modifications of the contract were made to reflect impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic which were unforeseeable at the time of entry into of the O&amp;M Contract and which impacted the contractor’s performance of the Operations and Maintenance Contract.  These modifications are summarised as follows: 
i)	A change to the contractual indexation provisions which allow for adjustments to payments of the Base Yearly Amount to the contractor as a result of annual changes to earnings of staff members performing the Services, which is calculated by reference to economic activities in the published Nomenclature of Economic Activities (“NACE”) index. The modification aligned the indexation mechanism to the most appropriate category of worker involved in the delivery of the services pursuant to the contract (rather than the NACE index identified in the contract, which grouped certain categories of worker together). This modification to the NACE Index resulted in an additional payment of €3,743,858 for the period to end of June 2024 (which was in addition to an earlier payment of €378,745 made in 2020 to reflect an initial assessment of the impacts of Covid-19 at the time). 
ii)	A revision to a contractual variation to deal with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic to provide additional relief for certain system performance deductions (e.g. Lost Kilometre Deductions, Excess Waiting Time Deductions, Fare Evasion Deductions, Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance and Infrastructure Maintenance Deductions) incurred by the contractor.  This modification included for additional relief in the form of a reimbursement of deductions previously charged against the contractor of €7,318,000 for the period 2020 to 2023 (which represented approximately 48% of the deductions applied / charged during this period).  The review and revision to the contractual variation also resulted in the reimbursement of the contractor for certain additional labour and sub-contractor costs incurred in performing the Services (i.e. seeking to run a full timetable) to the amount of €6,372,951 for the same period between 2020 to 2023. 
As noted above the contracting authorities have commenced the procurement competition for the next generation Luas Operations and Maintenance and therefore expect that the current / existing O&amp;M contract will not run for the full possible contract term of 132 months, which also means that the value of the contract will be lower than originally anticipated.</efbc:ReasonDescription>

      <cbc:Name languageID="ENG">Luas Operations and Maintenance Contract</cbc:Name>
      <cbc:Description languageID="ENG">The scope of the Luas Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Contract includes the following services to be performed by the Operator: operation of public light rail passenger services, rolling stock maintenance, infrastructure maintenance (e.g. depots, track, etc.) and management and operation of Luas Park and Ride sites. Maintenance of the automatic fare collection system is within the scope of the O&amp;M contract and undertaking asset renewal works for the infrastructure and tram vehicles. 
The possible full contract term is 132 months from operating commencement, which comprises an initial duration of 72 months with an option to extend by a further 60 months. The estimated value of the contract at the time of award was approximately €907,500,000 (excluding VAT) for the full possible contract term.  
The contract terms include fixed and variable rates, payments and deductions for volume of services provided, performance levels achieved and various maintenance and asset management activities. Contract payments for various items are index linked.

      <cbc:ProcurementTypeCode listName="contract-nature">services</cbc:ProcurementTypeCode>
      <cbc:Note languageID="ENG">NTA and TII are the joint contracting authority for this contract. 
Note that the Contracting Authorities decided to tender for a new contract for Luas Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) in 2024 and the contract notice for this procurement competition was dispatched 2nd February 2024 (OJEU reference 198460-2024). This is relevant additional information as the current / existing Operation &amp; Maintenance contract (“O&amp;M Contract”) will therefore not run for the full possible contract term of 132 months.  It is expected that the contract term will be for approximately 82 months and that the contract will expire during late 2026.  The exact timing of the contract expiry date is dependent on the timing of the contract award date relating to the procurement competition for the new O&amp;M contract. 
The value in field 2.1 above represents the original tendered value of the O&amp;M Contract for the full potential duration of 132 months.
The value of 577,500,000 represents the original tendered value of the O&amp;M Contract calculated over the now anticipated duration of 82 months.
The value of 540,000,000 represents the anticipated actual value of the O&amp;M Contract including this modification (20,000,000).  As can be seen from the values set out in this Notice, the modifications contemplated by this Modification Notice do not result in an increase in the value of the contract beyond that initially published.

         <cbc:Name languageID="ENG">Luas Operations and Maintenance Contract</cbc:Name>
         <cbc:Description languageID="ENG">Luas is Dublin's light rail system and consists of 2 lines, the Red Line and the Green Line. Luas is Dublin's light rail system and consists of 2 lines, the Red Line and the Green Line. The system currently comprises 37 kilometres of track, 2 maintenance depots, 54 stops and a fleet of 66 light rail vehicles. Luas carried 34 000 000 passenger journeys in 2016. A 5.6 kilometre extension to the Green Line is currently under construction and is scheduled to open in December 2017. The system will then comprise 43 kilometres of track, 3 depots and 73 light rail vehicles, and is expected to carry 42 000 000 passenger journeys in 2018. Further expansion of the system is anticipated and accordingly the scale of the contract with the successful tenderer may increase over its term. It is anticipated that the O&amp;M Contract will commence operations in Quarter 4, 2019 for a period of 6 years, with an option to extend by up to a further 5 years. There will be a mobilisation/transition period from the date of contract signing until the operating commencement date. It is envisaged that revenue risk will be borne by TII but that some fare evasion risk will be borne by the Operator. The passenger services to be provided by the operator will be defined by a service specification. There will be a performance monitoring system in place based on a number of key performance indicators. The full scope of services required was set out in the invitation to tender documentation which was issued to the successful parties who were shortlisted following the selection/pre-qualification stage of the procurement process.</cbc:Description>

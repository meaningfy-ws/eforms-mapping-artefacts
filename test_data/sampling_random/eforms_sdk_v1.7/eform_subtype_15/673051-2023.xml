The qualification system comprises several product groups: 60kV and 10-20kV arc suppression coils and 10-20kV earthing transformer. In the request to participate, the candidate must state which product group(s) the Candidate can supply and thus for which product group(s) the Candidate is requesting qualification. The Candidate is also asked to indicate in the request to participate which types the Candidate can supply within the individual product group. See annex, Request to participate to the Qualification system.

Norlys Holding A/S is the central purchasing body and is thus responsible for establishing and operating the qualification system as well as for the subsequent contract management on behalf of N1 A/S, Edison Park 1, 6715 Esbjerg N, Denmark. Company registration no. 25154150. Being a group company, Norlys Holding A/S handles procurement and warehouse facilities for N1 A/S. Admission to the qualification system does not imply that the Supplier will be awarded a contract. Admission to the qualification system means that the Supplier may be invited to tender for the contracts which the Contracting Entity may offer under the qualification system. Qualified Suppliers may only be invited to submit tenders within the list/product group for which the Supplier has qualified. The Contracting Entity may choose to divide the contract into the lots, which at the time of the call for competition are most suitable with respect to division in units, product groups and types. In connection with the Contracting Entity's procurement based on the qualification system, the Contracting Entity will decide whether the individual contract should be awarded by restricted or negotiated procedure. The Contracting Entity may also conclude a framework agreement based on the qualification system. As a general rule, the Contracting Entity will invite all Suppliers qualified in the individual product groups to submit tenders for the specific procurements conducted under the qualification system. However, the Contracting Entity reserves the right to limit the number of Suppliers and only issue procurement documents to the Suppliers that the Contracting Entity considers best qualified in relation to the specific procurement. In the selection, emphasis will be placed on the most relevant and comparable references in accordance with section 4.9. Likewise, the Contracting Entity may limit the number of Suppliers based on the types that the Suppliers have indicated they can supply within the individual product groups. See further information in the Qualification system.</cbc:Description><cbc:ProcurementTypeCode listName="contract-nature">supplies</cbc:ProcurementTypeCode><cbc:Note languageID="ENG">EU sanctions against Russia and Russian interests. Together with its request to participate, the Candidate must submit a solemn declaration that the company and the tender have no Russian involvement exceeding the limits set out in the Regulation. A template for this purpose is included in the qualification system.

The qualification system comprises several product groups: 60kV and 10-20kV arc suppression coils and 10-20kV earthing transformer. In the request to participate, the candidate must state which product group(s) the Candidate can supply and thus for which product group(s) the Candidate is requesting qualification. The Candidate is also asked to indicate in the request to participate which types the Candidate can supply within the individual product group. See annex, Request to participate to the Qualification system.

Norlys Holding A/S is the central purchasing body and is thus responsible for establishing and operating the qualification system as well as for the subsequent contract management on behalf of N1 A/S, Edison Park 1, 6715 Esbjerg N, Denmark. Company registration no. 25154150. Being a group company, Norlys Holding A/S handles procurement and warehouse facilities for N1 A/S. Admission to the qualification system does not imply that the Supplier will be awarded a contract. Admission to the qualification system means that the Supplier may be invited to tender for the contracts which the Contracting Entity may offer under the qualification system. Qualified Suppliers may only be invited to submit tenders within the list/product group for which the Supplier has qualified. The Contracting Entity may choose to divide the contract into the lots, which at the time of the call for competition are most suitable with respect to division in units, product groups and types. In connection with the Contracting Entity's procurement based on the qualification system, the Contracting Entity will decide whether the individual contract should be awarded by restricted or negotiated procedure. The Contracting Entity may also conclude a framework agreement based on the qualification system. As a general rule, the Contracting Entity will invite all Suppliers qualified in the individual product groups to submit tenders for the specific procurements conducted under the qualification system. However, the Contracting Entity reserves the right to limit the number of Suppliers and only issue procurement documents to the Suppliers that the Contracting Entity considers best qualified in relation to the specific procurement. In the selection, emphasis will be placed on the most relevant and comparable references in accordance with section 4.9. Likewise, the Contracting Entity may limit the number of Suppliers based on the types that the Suppliers have indicated they can supply within the individual product groups. See further information in the Qualification system.</cbc:Description><cbc:ProcurementTypeCode listName="contract-nature">supplies</cbc:ProcurementTypeCode><cbc:Note languageID="ENG">EU sanctions against Russia and Russian interests. Together with its request to participate, the Candidate must submit a solemn declaration that the company and the tender have no Russian involvement exceeding the limits set out in the Regulation.
